Requirement to connect to the internet.
- Physical Connection like (LAN, WIFI Chip).
- Logical Connection assume something is not real make it talk to each other.
- Application

**Physical Connection or NIC** (Network Integrated Circuit or Network Interface Circuit).
Needed the hardware.
Protocols - A sets of rules or languages for communication. If speak in the same protocol you can understand and communication like language.
- In Physical protocols use to define the end of the LAN line. Ethernet.
- We can connect from computer to computer by Token Ring.
- Wireless or Fiber Optics.

Physical connection will have a physical address. MAC-address media access control contain 48 bits. First 24 tells unique identity manufactory. The last 24 are unique number for each.

**Logical Connection** define another protocols TCP/IP protocols like address when you buying something and want to drop on that location.
IP-address today compose of 32 bits. 

**Application** it on top the program make it the same network.

**DHCP** (Service run on server or access point) the first service that the device will use to obtain IP automatically. The device will send DHCP request to the server. Server that run service will DHCP response the IP to the device. Default gateway like the gate to go to outside exploring the internet. If in the same network don't go to gateway.

**DNS (Domain Name Service)** to map the name to the IP address.

IP starting with 127 is loop back. 127.0.0.1 means on the 1st service or physical connection. If it no reply means NIC might die or the OS driver crash.

If ping my own IP to check the media connection is work or not.

Ping gateways to check the gate is opened ?
